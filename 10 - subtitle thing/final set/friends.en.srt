Super uplifting great song plays

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
MAKE SURE YOU CLAP

5
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,641
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

6
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,962
You're going out with a guy.

7
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:02,521
There's gotta be something
wrong with him.

8
00:01:02,872 --> 00:01:04,532
So does he have a hump
and a hair piece?

9
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:08,366
Wait. Does he eat chalk?

10
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:11,644
I don't want her to go
through what I did with Carl.

11
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:13,405
Okay, everybody relax.

12
00:01:13,952 --> 00:01:14,849
This is not even a date.

13
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:18,080
It's just two people going out to
dinner and not having sex.

14
00:01:18,492 --> 00:01:19,500
Sounds like a date to me.

15
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:22,971
smouldering Jazz interval plays...

16
00:01:23,812 --> 00:01:25,451
I'm in high school,
in the middle of the cafeteria. . .

17
00:01:25,692 --> 00:01:29,004
. . .and I realize I'm totally naked.

18
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,000
I've had that dream.

19
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:34,021
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone. . .

20
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:37,125
. . .there.

21
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:40,004
-Instead of--
-That's right!

22
00:01:40,492 --> 00:01:42,011
That one, I've never had.

23
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:45,204
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

24
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:48,932
And it turns out it's my mother.

25
00:01:50,572 --> 00:01:54,326
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

26
00:01:55,812 --> 00:01:59,531
Pensive melancholic jazz interval plays

27
00:02:00,312 --> 00:02:01,531
Hi

28
00:02:02,012 --> 00:02:05,531
This guy says, ''Hello,''
I wanna kill myself.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,281
You okay, sweetie?

30
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:12,003
I feel like someone grabbed my small
intestine, pulled it out of my mouth. . .

31
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:14,725
-. . .and tied it around my neck.
-Cookie?

32
00:02:16,772 --> 00:02:19,171
Carol moved out today.

33
00:02:20,212 --> 00:02:21,328
-Let me get you some coffee.
-Thanks.

34
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:29,526
-ew
- No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

35
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:33,447
Just leave my aura alone, okay?

36
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:38,284
I'll be fine.
I hope she'll be very happy.

37
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,447
No, you don't.

38
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,728
To hell with her. She left me!

39
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:45,127
And you never knew she was a lesbian.

40
00:02:49,812 --> 00:02:54,451
NO OK... Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

41
00:02:55,012 --> 00:02:58,526
She didn't know.
How should I know?

42
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:02,932
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

43
00:03:03,772 --> 00:03:06,728
Did I say that out loud?

44
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:12,164
Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

45
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:15,721
You're angry. You're hurting.

46
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:17,122
Can I tell you what
the answer is?

47
00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:19,606
Strip joints!

48
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:23,422
Come on, you're single.
Have some hormones.

49
00:03:23,572 --> 00:03:25,999
See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

50
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:29,330
I just want to be married again.

51
00:03:33,852 --> 00:03:36,843
And I just want a million dollars!

52
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:39,021
Rachel?

53
00:03:39,172 --> 00:03:42,561
Oh, God, Monica!
Hi! Thank God!

54
00:03:42,812 --> 00:03:45,324
I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said. . .

55
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:47,807
. . .that you might be here and you are.

56
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:49,524
-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.

57
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:56,968
Everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

58
00:03:57,172 --> 00:03:58,532
This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe. . .

59
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,167
. . .and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

60
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:01,922
Sure!

61 
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:06,922
Umbrella cock blocks Ross

61
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:16,130
You want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

62
00:04:18,532 --> 00:04:23,128
Oh, God! Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

63
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:25,840
I was in this room with
all the presents. . .

64
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:28,128
. . .and I was looking
at this gravy boat.

65
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:31,722
This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

66
00:04:32,032 --> 00:04:34,321
When all of a sudden I realize--
Sweet 'N Low?

67
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,848
I realized. . .

68
00:04:37,092 --> 00:04:39,687
. . .I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

69
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:43,565
And then I really freaked out,
when it hit me:

70
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:45,326
How much Barry looks like
Mr. Potato Head.

71
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:48,225
I always knew he looked
familiar, but. . . .

72
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,923
I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering. . .

73
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:58,602
. . . ''Why am I doing this?''
and ''Who am I doing this for?''

74
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:03,050
I didn't know where to go, and I know
you and I have drifted apart. . .

75
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:05,931
. . .but you're the only person
I know in the city.

76
00:05:06,532 --> 00:05:08,770
Who wasn't asked to the wedding.

77
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:11,925
I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.

78
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:13,055
small jazz interval plays

79 
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:18,925
upbeat guitar builds up the vibe 

80
00:05:21,172 --> 00:05:24,242
Corny Spanish telenovela plays in TV

80
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:29,242
I guess he bought her
the pipe organ. . .

81
00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:31,926
. . .and she's really not
happy about it.

82
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,169
Daddy, I just--
I can't marry him.

83
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:37,171
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:39,326
I just don't love him.

85
00:05:40,412 --> 00:05:43,682
Well, it matters to me!


86
00:05:45,372 --> 00:05:48,845
She should not be
wearing those pants.

87
00:05:49,272 --> 00:05:51,463
I say push her down the stairs!

88
00:05:51,512 --> 00:05:56,606
Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!

89
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,444
Come on, Daddy, listen!

90
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:05,487
All my life, everyone's
always told me, ''You're a shoe! ''

91
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,407
''You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe! ''

92
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:11,564
I stopped and said,
''What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

93
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:14,248
What if I want to be a purse?

94
00:06:14,452 --> 00:06:16,726
Or a hat?''

95
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:20,041
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I--

96
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:22,528
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

97
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:25,821
You can see where he'd have trouble.

98
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,763
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

99
00:06:32,212 --> 00:06:35,324
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

100
00:06:37,972 --> 00:06:40,830
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

101
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,822
Well, maybe that's my decision.

102
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:47,328
Well, maybe I don't need your money.

103
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,729
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

104
00:06:51,932 --> 00:06:54,029
Smooth riffing jazz music plays

105
00:06:54,232 --> 00:06:57,729
A single suggestive note lingers...

106
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,965
Just breathe.
Breathe, that's it.

107
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:02,321
Just try to think
of nice, calm things.

108
00:07:03,572 --> 00:07:07,042
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

109
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:11,205
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

110
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:14,362
La la la something
And noodles with string

111
00:07:16,112 --> 00:07:17,228
-These are a--
-I'm all better now.

112
00:07:18,912 --> 00:07:19,825
I helped.

113
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:25,447
This is probably for
the best, you know?

114
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:28,352
Independence.
Taking control of your life.

115
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:32,544
If you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.

116
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:36,443
Me and Chandler live across the hall.
And he's away a lot.

117
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:41,726
Joey, stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

118
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:43,532
What? Like there's
a rule or something?

119
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:48,923
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

120
00:07:49,172 --> 00:07:50,730
It's Paul.

121
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:51,548
Buzz him in.

122
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:54,026
-Who's Paul?
-Paul, the wine guy?

123
00:07:54,132 --> 00:07:55,328
Maybe.

124
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:59,289
Your ''not a real date,''
is with Paul, the wine guy?

125
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:00,209
He finally asked you out?

126
00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:01,409
YEESSSS!!!

127
00:08:01,412 --> 00:08:03,091
It's a ''Dear Diary'' moment.

128
00:08:04,072 --> 00:08:06,245
Rach, I can cancel.

129
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,007
Oh, God. Please, no.
Go, I'll be fine.

130
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:10,446
Ross are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

131
00:08:12,212 --> 00:08:13,525
That'd be good.

132
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:19,000
-Really?
-Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

133
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:25,162
Hi, come in! Paul, this is. . .

134
00:08:25,892 --> 00:08:28,247
. . .everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

135
00:08:28,532 --> 00:08:34,361
-The wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name. Paul?

136
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:37,127
Change. Sit down.
Two seconds.

137
00:08:40,172 --> 00:08:44,328
I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

138
00:08:45,912 --> 00:08:48,443
Rachel, what are you
up to tonight?

139
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:53,266
I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon. . .

140
00:08:53,272 --> 00:08:54,725
. . .so, nothing.

141
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:59,529
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

142
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:03,923
Although, Aruba. This time of year?
Talk about your. . .

143
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:07,771
. . .big lizards.

144
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:14,611
If you don't feel
like being alone tonight. . .

145
00:09:14,852 --> 00:09:18,730
. . .Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

146
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:19,921
And we're very excited about it.

147
00:09:21,872 --> 00:09:25,505
Thanks. But I'm just gonna
hang out here.

148
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:27,121
-It's been a long day.
-Okay. Sure.

149
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:28,687
Pheebs, wanna help?

150
00:09:28,712 --> 00:09:31,207
I wish I could, but I don't want to.

151
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:37,807
Riotous jazz run plays as we pan up to the next scene

152
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:42,971
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things. . .

153
00:09:43,212 --> 00:09:46,522
. . .using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

154
00:09:47,592 --> 00:09:52,529
I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever. . .

155
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:55,250
. . .and I cannot feel my legs.


156
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:58,540
What's this?

157
00:09:58,692 --> 00:10:01,826
-I have no idea.

158
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:05,087
-Done with the bookcase.
-All finished.

159
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:12,926
This was Carol's favorite beer.

160
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:15,524
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

161
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:18,986
Let me ask you a question.

162
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:22,530
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

163
00:10:22,732 --> 00:10:24,767
What did you get?

164
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:26,522
You guys.

165
00:10:26,732 --> 00:10:28,563
-You got screwed.
-Oh, my God.

166
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:32,328
-Oh, my God.
-I know. I'm such an idiot.

167
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:37,564
I should've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.

168
00:10:37,712 --> 00:10:39,582
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

170
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:42,522
My brother's going through that.
He's a mess.

171
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:44,165
How did you get through it?

172
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,768
He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

173
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:50,286
-Say her--
-Leg?

174
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:52,483
That's one way of going through it.

175
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:54,491
Me, I went for the watch.

176
00:10:55,032 --> 00:10:56,410
You actually broke her watch?

177
00:10:57,012 --> 00:11:00,970
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

178
00:11:01,212 --> 00:11:05,127
You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

179
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:10,026
It's about me.
And I just--

180
00:11:15,032 --> 00:11:18,285
Machine cut me off again.
Anyway. . . .


181
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:25,125
You know what's scary? What if there
is only one woman for everybody?

182
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:27,523
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

183
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:32,408
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

184
00:11:33,212 --> 00:11:36,329
What are you talking about?
One woman.

185
00:11:36,892 --> 00:11:41,368
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

186
00:11:41,612 --> 00:11:44,321
Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.

187
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:49,611
Rocky road, and cookie dough,
and bing cherry vanilla.

188
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:54,683
You can get them with jimmies,
or nuts, or whipped cream.

189
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:58,026
This is the best thing that
ever happened to you!

190
00:11:58,272 --> 00:12:01,245
You got married. You were
like, what? Eight?

191
00:12:02,812 --> 00:12:06,521
Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!

192
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:09,561
I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

193
00:12:10,132 --> 00:12:11,929
Then stay out of my freezer.

194
00:12:15,412 --> 00:12:17,643
Ever since she
walked out on me, I. . . .

195
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,769
What? What?

196
00:12:21,012 --> 00:12:22,242
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

197
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:27,582
It's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

198
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:30,050
So there's going to be a fifth date?

199
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:32,548
Isn't there?

200
00:12:33,932 --> 00:12:36,368
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

201
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:38,728
What were you going to say?

202
00:12:40,532 --> 00:12:46,082
Ever since she left me. . .

203
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,962
. . .I haven't been able to perform. . .

204
00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:53,531
. . .sexually.

205
00:12:55,212 --> 00:12:56,011
Oh, God! Oh, God!

206
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:58,021
I'm so sorry.

207
00:12:58,872 --> 00:13:01,528
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

208
00:13:04,732 --> 00:13:05,608
How long?

209
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:08,168
Two years.

210
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:12,525
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

211
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:18,723
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

212
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:23,731
Yeah, I do.

213
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,723
CORNY MOVIE PLAYING

213
00:13:31,172 --> 00:13:35,723
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

214
00:13:39,692 --> 00:13:41,410
''Grab a spoon. ''

215
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:43,843
Do you know long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

216
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:47,323
Do the words, ''Billy, don't be a
hero,'' mean anything to you?

217
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:53,828
You know, here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough. . .

218
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:56,024
. . .to ask a woman out. . .

219
00:13:56,412 --> 00:13:58,528
. . .who am I going to ask?

220 
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:08,528
Mushy 90s pop plays as Rachel looks super sad

221 
00:14:09,412 --> 00:14:12,528
PART 2 WILL PROBABLY COME ...

222 
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:14,528
...AT SOME POINT
